# MobileApps-Fall2015
My personal iOS and Android mobile app assignments for Mobile App Development at CU Boulder.
Fall 2015 semester


##iOS Mobile App Projects
1. daVinci
Objective: Create an app that presents the user with 3 buttons which when pressed changes both an image and some text. This app can be designed for iPhone only. Don't forget your app icons as well.
Assignment: I added 5 buttons that change the main image and added text next to each button. I created a function that cleared the other text after each button was pressed, and I created another function that changed the font family and size of the text. I hope you like pictures of cute kittens :)
